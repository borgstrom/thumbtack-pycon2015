PyCon2015 Thumbtack Beer Mug Challenge
======================================

Pass in a string of digits where the last digit is the answer and this will
determine if there is a possible combination of digits and operations that
evaluate to the final answer.

Example:

    ❯❯❯ echo '3 2 1 4 5 6 3' | python3 beer.py 
    3 + 2 + 1 - 4 - 5 + 6 = 3

Thanks for the Beer Mugs Thumbtack!
